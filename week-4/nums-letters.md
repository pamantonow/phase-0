Reflection:
We got in ruby print, puts and p all of them do about the same function this print something to the string.
puts will put a string or integer in two lines.
An integer is a whole number that being said it has no decimals, a float it's a number with a decimal, the difference
between this two is that if you have an integer number and a float , you might have to change either one to a float 
or integre becuase it won't work since the integer is a whole number.
