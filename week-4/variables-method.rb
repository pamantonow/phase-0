#To define a local variable you set a string equal to either a number , empty "" or just equal another string
#To define a a method , you write def and add a method name and always always have to end the method and otherwise
#it won't run. The difference between a local variable and a method is that for a local variable you just set it 
#equal to something and a method you are actually defining and specific argument.
#to run a ruby program in your command line you want to write either rspec and the name of your rspec method or ruby
#something.rb
#Everything was pretty good and I felt pretty confident doing the work and I really enjoyed
